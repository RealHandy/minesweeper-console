# minesweeper-console
Play Minesweeper in the console in Node.js

## Usage

Install it:

`npm i minesweeper-console`

Play it:

`node node_modules/minesweeper-console/game.js` (MacOS/Linux)
`node node_modules\minesweeper-console\game.js` (Windows)


## Controls

- WASD or OKL; or 8456 to move the cursor
- [SPACE] to reveal a location
- B to mark/unmark a location as having bomb
- Q to quit

At the start, you can specify the width and height of the board (up to 99 in each direction) and the number of bombs to be placed on the board.


## Why?

Why not? It's not fully structured code, so it's not of particular educational value, but it might be of use for something.

(And I'm learning publishing to npm, so there's that.)

## History

- 1.0.0 Initial version
- 1.0.1 npm published version (np says it's failing to publish but it's not)
- 1.0.2 Figuring out bin
